Cities governments across the United States are implementing policies and programs aimed at attracting and retaining foreign born residents. Some of these include language access initiatives, entrepreneurship support programs targeted towards immigrants, and establishing local government offices or commissions for immigrant affairs.

[New American Economy](newamericaneconomy.org) a bipartisan immigration research and advocacy organization, annually collects data on immigration-related city policies for the 100 largest cities in the United States. They use this data to create the <i>NAE Cities Index</i>, a “scorecard” which ranks American cities by how inclusive their policies and practices are for foreign-born residents.

This dashboard uses New American Economy’s data to explore visual correlations between <i>Cities Index</i> scores and characteristics about the demographics and socioeconomic outcomes of the city’s residents. The graphs here do not imply causation, but are a way to explore which cities are implementing policies aimed at attracting and retaining immigrants.
